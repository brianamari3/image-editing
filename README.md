# image-editing
**(there will be 3-5 images provided that the user can choose from)**
*it will allow the user to select one of the images available.*
the program will ask the user which part they would like to select and then ask whether they want to add color or blur a part of the image. 
*there will be an option, of course, to delete or erase any parts that they do not want to keep*
*they will be able to therefore change the color or focus and blur the selected part of the image*
*the image will be represented with a grid*
after editing the user can choose to continue editing or choose to be done 
once they are done they can do it again and try another image

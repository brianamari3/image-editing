# image-editing
**(there will be 3-5 images provided that the user can choose from)**

*the image will be represented with a grid*

*it will allow the user to select one of the images available.*
the program will ask the user which part they would like to select and then ask whether they want to add color or blur a part of the image. 
*after selecting an image the program will automatically turn it black and white to choose the brightness or be able to choose it based on a smaller scale of shades opposed to the many colors and shades of those colors as well*

*there will be an option, of course, to delete or erase any parts that they do not want to keep*
*they will be able to therefore change the color or focus and blur the selected part of the image*

another option would be for the user to rotate the image or change the way the image was displayed (if they want the image sideways, the way they want the image to be facing)

after editing the user can choose to continue editing or choose to be done 
once they are done they can do it again and try another image
